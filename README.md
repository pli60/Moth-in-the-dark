Description & Inspiring behavior:
        This is a simulation of a swarm of moths following a indicated pattern of movement. In this simulation, the flock moths have 3 movement patterns include: coming together as a group, moving towards a same direction with a slight randomness, and seperating from the group randomly. The flocks are limited within the window in the scene. They are also attracted by the light/lamp that players can place in the scene and will fly around the light scource indefinitely.

Artist Statement:
        I'm trying to simulate the grouping behavior of moths as well as when they are attracted to lights. I believe my simulation has a decent representation of how moths behave. It displays the disorganized grouping behavior of moth as well as their attraction towards light.
